Release version 0.5

This package provides a generic interface for user to communicate with Samsung's Key Value SSD through different types of device drivers (user space, and kernel space), and a Samsung Key Value SSD emulator.

How to build:
    0. Install dependencies
       ./tools/install_deps.sh
    1. mkdir build
    2. cd build
    3. Three types of driver is available : kernel driver (KDD); emulator (EMU); user space driver (SPDK)
       User can compile one of them with following options:

       Kernel Device Driver
       =======
       cmake -DWITH_KDD=ON ../

       Emulator 
       =======
       cmake -DWITH_EMU=ON ../

       User Space Driver
       =======
       cmake -DWITH_SPDK=ON ../ 
       * Replace <main_source_dir>/lib/libkvnvmedd.a if there is newer version of spdk driver available
       * The pre-build library is on gcc version 5.4.0
       * https://github.com/OpenMPDK/uNVMe

    4. make -j<# of cores>

How to test
    library and test binaries are at:
    build/

    1. Test with Kernel Driver
    - nvme kernel module needs to be compiled and installed

    ./sample_test --h

    ./sample_test -d device_path [-n num_ios] [-q queue_depth] [-o op_type] [-k klen] [-v vlen] [-p is_polling]



TODO:
---
  1. Add sample test code for SPDK
  2. Add iteration sample test code
